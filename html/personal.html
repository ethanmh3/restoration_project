            <h3 class="sub-heading">What is It?</h3>
            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every one on this earth was born with the light of Christ. This internal light is a gift given to us from our Heavenly
                Father. The light of Christ helps us to be able to discern between truth and error. In a sense, the light of Christ could be considered a form of personal revelation, helping to protect 
                us against deception.
            </p>
            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, personal revelation is more strongly associated with the gift of the Holy Ghost. When someone is baptized under the correct authority,
                they also have hands laid on their head by those who have authority to give them the gift of the Holy Ghost to complete the baptism. Having the gift of the Holy Ghost essentially means that one
                is entitled to having the Holy Ghost be their constant companion, provided that they are not acting in ways which would offend the Spirit. Having the Holy Ghost with us 
                can help guide us in our decisions throughout the day as well as help us to make the big decisions in life through still, small, promptings.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Personal Revelation Tests</h3>
            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personal revelation can be a tricky subject, because it's something that could easily be exploited and used for justification
                of incorrect thoughts and actions if we aren't careful. To protect against this, there are three tests by which we should run anything we consider to be personal revelation.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="text list" style="text-decoration: underline">The Stewardship Test</li>
                    <p class="text listindent">The main point of the stewardship test is to check whether or not the revelation pertains to something that is within our own stewardship. That is to say,
                        whether or not the revelation has to do with something that we have been given responsibility over. One will not receive personal revelation for something that he or she does not
                        have responsibility for or stewarship over.
                    </p>
                <li class="text list" style="text-decoration: underline"> The Brethren Test</li>
                    <p class="text listindent">Another important check for personal revelation is to test it against what the prophet and apostles are teaching. We can find comfort knowing that
                        we will never receive personal revelation to do something which is contrary to the revelation that they receive for the whole church. If the unanimous voice of the First Presidency
                        and the Quorum of the 12 Apostles is teaching one thing, we won't receive revelation contrary to that teaching.
                    </p>
                <li class="text list" style="text-decoration: underline">The Fruits Test</li>
                    <p class="text listindent">Finally, we should always be aware of the fruits of the revelation. Does the revelation that we believe we have received produce the fruits of the Spirit? 
                        Does it help us to make and keep our covenants? We know from the scriptures that anything which is good is of God, so it's important to check whether or not our personal revelation 
                    bears the fruits of goodness and righteousness. 
                    </p>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">How to Receive Personal Revelation</h3>
            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord commands us that we should "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" <a style="color: black; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=118#p118">(D&C 88:118)</a>.
            This scripture is a great guide for receiving revelation. We should work to study out answers in our minds and have the faith that God will teach us the truth if we do so. The Holy Ghost can help
            us receive the personal revelation we need especially as we study the scriptures and pray.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text list">Scripture Study</li>
                    <li class="text listindent">When we study the scriptures, the Spirit can open our minds to understand passages better or in a different way than before. At the same time, it can help us to make 
                        personal applications to what the verses mean for our own lives and circumstances.
                    </li>
                <li class="text list">Prayer</li>
                    <li class="text listindent">When we pray, the Holy Ghost can confirm truth to our hearts if we are willing to first put in the work and then ask.</li>
                <p class="text longquote">"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
                </p>
                <p class="text longquote">"And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."

            <h3 class="sub-heading">A Framework for Personal Revelation</h3>
            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During the October 2022 General Conference, Elder Dale G. Renlund gave a very informative talk on the personal revelation. During his talk, he 
                outlined four elements of the framework for personal revelation and taught many more important truths pertaining to the subject. Give it a listen!

                <li class="text listindent">"Feasting on the words of Christ, as found in the scriptures, stimulates personal revelation."</li>
                <li class="text listindent">"We receive personal revelation only within our purview and not within the prerogative of others."</li>
                <li class="text listindent">"Personal revelation will be in harmony with the commandments of God and the covenants we have made with Him."</li>
