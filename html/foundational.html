            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joseph Smith himself was confused by all the contention and difference of opinion in the religious world. He decided to seek 
                answers straight from God on the subject and described his experience as follows:</p>
            <p class="text longquote"> "My object in going to enquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner therefore did I get possession
                 of myself so as to be able to speak, than I asked the personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right, (for at this time it had never entered into
                  my heart that all were wrong) and which I should join. I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong, and the Personage who addressed me said that all 
                  their Creeds were an abomination in his sight, that those professors were all corrupt, that “they draw near to me to with their lips but their hearts are far from me, They 
                  teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of Godliness but they deny the power thereof. I was informed that I was chosen to be an instrument in the hands of 
                  God to bring about some of his purposes in this glorious dispensation.” <span class="source">- Joseph Smith Papers

            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joseph acted in faith, received revelation straight from God pertaining to the truthfulness of the gospel, and was called to be His prophet to leading
                the restoration of His church to the earth once more. As part of this restoration, Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger, Moroni, to uncover an ancient record and translate
            its contents. </p>

            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ came with an additional book of scripture known as the Doctrine and Covenants. This book contains many of the revelations received
                by Joseph Smith as well as inspired declarations of truth. Each was given to help establish and govern the kingdom of God on the earth. The Doctrine and Covenants is especially important to the Latter-day Church for its revelations on the temple. 
                The Lord gave His reasons for having this book as follows:
            </p>
            <p class="text longquote"> "For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;</p>
            <p class="text longquote"> "They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</p>
            <p class="text longquote"> "Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;"

            <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During his time as prophet, Joseph Smith brought forth even more scripture through the gift and power of revelation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text list">The Books of Moses and Abraham</li>
                    <li class="text listindent">Both books were revealed to Joseph Smith in different ways. They expound more upon the lives of these Old Testament prophets and contain vital teachings; similar to those learned in the temple.

                    <li class="text listindent">Part of what Joseph learned from his personal encounter with God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ was how many plain and precious truths were lost from the original contents of the Bible. 
                        To help correct some of these errors and make some passages more clear for the learning of church members, Joseph carried out a "translation" of the Bible. <a style="color: black" target="_blank" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/revelations-in-context/joseph-smiths-bible-translation?lang=eng">Learn more here.</a>
